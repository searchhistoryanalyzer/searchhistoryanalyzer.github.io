    <h1>Input Data</h1>

    <p>This service lets you make your “mental portrait” by analyzing the history of your google searches over the years.</p>
    <p>All data are processed locally - you never share it to our servers. Also you’ll be able to delete any undesired words from the results of analysis. But first, you need to complete a bit tricky procedure of retrieving the input data from Google.</p>
    <p>To obtain the data, visit Google Takout page, select the “Search History” checkbox (and uncheck others), then download and unzip your archive.</p>
    <p>To begin analysis, drag and drop desired JSON files from “Search History” folder to this window. Or use the button below:</p>
    <input type="file" class="choose" multiple/>
